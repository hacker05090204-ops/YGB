---

## 5. Expiration Logic

```python
def should_retain(record: AuditRecord) -> bool:
    age_days = (now() - record.timestamp).days
    retention_days = RETENTION_PERIODS[record.type]
    
    if record.type == "evidence_chain":
        return True  # Never expire
    
    return age_days < retention_days
```

---

## 6. Disposal

- Expired records: Secure deletion with certificate
- No disposal of immutable records
- Quarterly disposal review

---

## 7. Compliance
