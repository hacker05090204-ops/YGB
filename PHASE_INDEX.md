# PHASE INDEX — YGB Repository

**Status:** REIMPLEMENTED-2026  
**Document Type:** Repository-Level Phase Governance  
**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Authority:** Human-Only  

---

## Purpose

This document establishes the **canonical phase ordering** for the YGB repository and enforces **phase immutability**.

---

## Phase Registry

| Phase | Name | Status | Immutable |
|-------|------|--------|-----------|
| **01** | Core Constants, Identities, and Invariants | **FROZEN** | ✅ YES |
| **02** | Actor & Role Model | FROZEN | ✅ YES |

---

## Phase-01 Declaration

**Phase-01 is hereby declared as the SOLE FOUNDATION of this system.**

### Immutability Guarantee

Phase-01 is **IMMUTABLE** and **CANNOT** be:
- Modified without explicit governance reopening
- Extended without formal amendment
- Reinterpreted without human authorization
- Overridden by any future phase
- Bypassed by any system component

### Legal Immutability Statement

> Phase-01 represents the legally binding constraints of this system.
> Any attempt to modify, circumvent, or reinterpret Phase-01 without
> explicit human-authorized governance reopening constitutes a
> violation of system integrity and may result in legal liability.

---

## Phase Ordering Lock

The canonical phase ordering is:

1. **Phase-01** — Core Constants, Identities, and Invariants (FOUNDATION)
2. **Phase-02** — Actor & Role Model (DEPENDS ON Phase-01)
3. **Future phases** — Must depend on Phase-01 and Phase-02

**No phase may be inserted before Phase-01.**
**No phase may override Phase-01 invariants.**

## Mutation Prevention Guarantee

### Prohibited Actions

The following actions are **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**:

1. ❌ Modifying Phase-01 constants
2. ❌ Disabling Phase-01 invariants
3. ❌ Overriding Phase-01 identities
4. ❌ Adding execution logic to Phase-01
5. ❌ Adding network access to Phase-01
6. ❌ Adding background processing to Phase-01
7. ❌ Adding AI autonomous authority
8. ❌ Adding scoring, ranking, or severity

### Required for Any Phase-01 Change

Any modification to Phase-01 **REQUIRES**:

1. Explicit human authorization
2. Formal governance reopening document
3. Security review
4. Test verification
5. Audit trail

## Governance Safety Notice

### AI Autonomy Prohibition

> **NOTICE:** No AI system, automated agent, or machine learning model
> may exercise autonomous authority within this system.
> 
> All AI actions MUST be:
> - Human-initiated
> - Human-approved
> - Human-auditable
> - Human-revocable

### Human Authority Requirement

> **REQUIREMENT:** All future phases MUST enforce human authority
> as defined in Phase-01. No phase may grant autonomous authority
> to any system component.

---

## Non-Authoritative Disclaimer

> **DISCLAIMER:** Phase-01 contains NO execution authority.
> Phase-01 CANNOT initiate actions.
> Phase-01 ONLY defines constraints and invariants.
> Phase-01 is a passive definition layer, not an active executor.
