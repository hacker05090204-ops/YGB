# PHASE-02 GOVERNANCE OPENING

**Status:** REIMPLEMENTED-2026  
**Phase:** 02 — Actor & Role Model  
**Date:** 2026-01-21  
**Author:** Human-Authorized Reconstruction  

---

## Declaration

This document officially opens Phase-02 of the `kali-mcp-toolkit-rebuilt` project.

Phase-02 builds upon the frozen foundation of Phase-01.

---

## Phase-02 Scope

Phase-02 defines and enforces the **Actor & Role Model**:

1. **Actor Taxonomy** — Define all actor types
2. **Trust Boundaries** — Establish trust levels between actors
3. **Role Definitions** — Human vs System roles
4. **Permission Model** — What each role can do
5. **No Execution Authority** — System cannot act alone

---

## Dependencies

Phase-02 REQUIRES Phase-01 invariants:
- HUMAN authority is absolute
- No autonomous execution
- No background actions
- No scoring or ranking
- Mutation requires confirmation
- Everything is auditable
- Everything is explicit

---

## Constraints

- This phase is **REIMPLEMENTED-2026**
- This phase defines **actor and role model**
- This phase contains **no execution logic**
- This phase will be **frozen after completion**
- **NO automation**
- **NO scoring**
- **NO execution authority for SYSTEM**

## Authorization

Work on Phase-02 is authorized to begin upon creation of this document.

All Phase-02 implementations MUST obey Phase-01 invariants.
