## Declaration

This document officially opens Phase-01 of the `kali-mcp-toolkit-rebuilt` project.

This is a **clean re-implementation** — NOT a recovery of lost code.

---

## Phase-01 Scope

Phase-01 defines and enforces the **non-negotiable foundation** of the system:

1. **Human authority is absolute**
2. **No autonomous execution**
3. **No background actions**
4. **No scoring or ranking**
5. **No mutation without human confirmation**
6. **Everything is auditable**
7. **Everything is explicit**

## Constraints

- This phase is **REIMPLEMENTED-2026**
- This phase defines **system invariants**
- This phase contains **no execution logic**
- This phase will be **frozen after completion**

---

## Authorization

Work on Phase-01 is authorized to begin upon creation of this document.

All subsequent phases MUST obey the invariants established here.
