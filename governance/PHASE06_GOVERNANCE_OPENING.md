## CONSTRAINTS FOR PHASE-06

Any future Phase-06 implementation MUST:

1. **Import only from Phase-01 through Phase-05** - No forward coupling
2. **Preserve human override precedence** - HUMAN authority is supreme
3. **Achieve 100% test coverage** - No untested code
4. **Pass zero-trust audit** - Before freeze
5. **NOT weaken any prior invariant** - Invariants are immutable
6. **NOT add execution logic** - Unless explicitly authorized
7. **NOT modify frozen phases** - Read-only access to prior phases

---

## PHASE-06 SCOPE PLACEHOLDER

> **NOTE:** The specific scope of Phase-06 has not yet been defined.
>
> The following are potential directions for Phase-06, pending human authorization:
>
> - Action Orchestration Layer
> - Decision Pipeline
> - Execution Control
> - Audit Trail System
> - Other (TBD)

The actual scope MUST be defined in `PHASE06_REQUIREMENTS.md` before any implementation authorization.
