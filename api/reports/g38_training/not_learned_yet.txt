The following abilities are PERMANENTLY LOCKED by governance:

  - bug_decision
  - severity_labeling
  - exploit_logic
  - submission_logic
  - verification
  - scope_expansion
  - governance_override
  - network_training
  - active_training

REASON:
  Governance guards prevent learning these abilities

ENFORCEMENT:
  Governance Enforced: True
  Guards Active: ALL
  Override Possible: NO

EXPLANATION:
  G38 is designed as an ADVISORY system only.
  It learns HOW systems LOOK (representation learning),
  NOT what constitutes a bug or how to exploit.
  
  Bug decisions require:
  - G33: Verified proof from human
  - G36: Auto-verification from deterministic checks
  
  G38 can RECOMMEND, but NEVER DECIDE.
